# rohitashwa_project

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project displays a user management system.
It displays no internet errors when the internet isn't available.
It also navigates according to the user authentication status.
Certain extra features have been added, which could be incomplete.
They were planned but couldn't be added due to lack of time but will be added in future.
MVVM architecture is used and the best possible approaches have been used for the development.
Over -commenting isn't done as the variable and function names are self-explanatory,
